Sudoku

Hello and Welcome to our Sudoku game! This game is designed to be a java applet.  There are several ways that you are able to run applet jars.  Applets are meant to be embedded in websites and run through an internet browser.  If you wish to run our applet this is an option.  However, I do not suggest this.  

Instead I suggest that you run our applet through Eclipse running Java 8.  

First, install java 8 from the following link: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html

Second, install eclipse from the following link: https://eclipse.org/

Next you need to import that project into eclipse.  Go to file->import->existing projects into workspace.  Once you have done this click browse and navigate to the projects director on your computer.  Select the project folder and hit finish.  The project should now be open in eclipse.  Now launch the project by hitting the run button in the tool bar above (it looks like a green play arrow).  The Sudoku game will launch!
